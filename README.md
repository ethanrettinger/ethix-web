# Ethix
Psuedoshell I wrote in javascript to interact with a containerized filesystem. The github version of Ethix. Essentially, you're interacting with a nodejs backend using a frontend web-based terminal.

## HOW TO START
All you need to do is type `node app.js` a terminal environment pointing to the project directory and your Ethix backend will be started. You can interact with this backend by opening your browser and navigating to http://localhost

## TODO LIST
1. Host online repository with packages
2. Make documentation more verbose and descriptive
3. Optimize existing code
4. Add themes
5. Add user profiles
