# Ethix
Psuedoshell I wrote in javascript to interact with a filesystem. Has an embedded package manager and repository

## TODO LIST
1) ~~When fetching for a package in the local /packages folder, read the package json and set the srcs to those scripts as well~~
2) Create an API for hotkeys and an event listener 
3) Host an online repository with packages that users can download from the command line at any time
4) ~~Log the previous commands and write them into the console when the page loads~~
5) Add user accounts and authentication stored in a hashed file locally
6) Add more default commands to the script.js file
7) ~~Make the code more organized (like separating default commands into its own file)~~
